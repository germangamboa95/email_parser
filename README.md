# Simple Email Parser 

## Summary: 

Email parsing is hard due to the fact that the standards vary so wildly. I manged to impletement the basics. Right now when the parser is ran it returns an object with some basic information about the email. The part that extracts data from the body needs more work. 

## Next Steps 

- Add a way to parse the email body with Cherio if it is text/html. 

- Create a body parser that handles the multiple part type of emails.
