Today was a pretty nice day. Sean wasn't able to come in since he was in an=
 accident. I was able to call Shakira in at 6 which really helped out. I ha=
d Steven run dine side and he did aight... He needed help with some orders =
and when he got backed up but other than that he did well. Lester helped hi=
m on the line when he got backed up which was great to see Lester take char=
ge but I did tell him not to take over the line but just to help him. It wa=
s an On and Off kind of night. We got a late pop of traditional wings and s=
ince we were doing cook to order we didn't have many wings on hand. We also=
 had a couple of costumers come 5 mins before close and ask for all their f=
ood fresh which had them sitting at the window for a while.
